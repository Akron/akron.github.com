{"name":"Sojolicious","tagline":"A toolkit for the Federated Social Web","body":"Sojolicious is a toolkit for the federated social web, containing\r\nplugins for the powerful web framework [Mojolicious](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mojolicious)\r\nwritten in Perl.\r\n\r\n# Synopsis\r\n\r\n```perl\r\n  use Mojolicious::Lite;\r\n\r\n  # Load Plugins\r\n  plugin 'WebFinger';\r\n  plugin 'PubSubHubbub';\r\n  plugin 'Salmon';\r\n\r\n  # Esablish Salmon Endpoints:\r\n  group {\r\n    under '/salmon';\r\n    (any '/:acct/mentioned')->salmon('mentioned');\r\n    (any '/:acct/all-replies')->salmon('all-replies');\r\n    (any '/signer')->salmon('signer');\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  # Add pubsubhubbub callback url\r\n  (any '/pubsub')->pubsub;\r\n\r\n  hook on_salmon_follow => sub {\r\n    # ... You received a follow request\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  hook on_pubsub_content => sub {\r\n    my ($c, $type, $dom) = @_;\r\n    # ... You receive feed information you subscribed to\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  app->start;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\n\r\nSojolicious mainly focus on support for the L<OStatus|http://ostatus.org/>\r\nmeta protocol and aims for a straight forward implementation of all\r\nsurrounding specifications.\r\n\r\nThe design goal is to make all plugins useful on their own,\r\nas separated building blocks of OStatus, while playing well\r\nwith each other. All plugins are application (despite the fact\r\nthat they are Mojolicious plugins) and storage agnostic,\r\nproviding event driven hooks for usage.\r\n\r\nSome plugins will become separated distributions, in case this is useful.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the following plugins were already seperated:\r\n\r\n* [Test](http://url)\r\n* [Crypt-MagicSignatures-Key](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-MagicSignatures-Key/) and [Crypt-MagicSignatures-Envelope](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-MagicSignatures-Envelope/)\r\n* [Mojolicious-Plugin-PubSubHubbub](https://github.com/Akron/Mojolicious-Plugin-PubSubHubbub)\r\n* [XML-Loy](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-MagicSignatures-Key/)\r\n\r\nSojolicious is work in progress. There are missing parts currently developed\r\nand existing parts reworked. Don't use it in its current status!\r\nHowever, you can use all separated parts published on CPAN.\r\n\r\n# Plugins for ...\r\n\r\n* [ActivityStreams](http://activitystrea.ms/specs/atom/1.0/)\r\n* [Atom](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt)\r\n* [Atom-Threading-Extension](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4685.txt)\r\n* [HostMeta](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-hostmeta)\r\n* [MagicSignatures](http://salmon-protocol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/draft-panzer-magicsig-01.html)\r\n* [OStatus](http://ostatus.org/sites/default/files/ostatus-1.0-draft-2-specification.html)\r\n* [PortableContacts](http://portablecontacts.net/draft-spec.html)\r\n* [PubSubHubbub](https://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pubsubhubbub-core-0.3.html)\r\n* [Salmon](http://salmon-protocol.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/draft-panzer-salmon-00.html)\r\n* [XRD](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/xrd/v1.0/xrd-1.0.html)\r\n* [Webfinger](http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/WebFingerProtocol)\r\n\r\nThere are plans to expand the scope to other social protocols later,\r\nfor example [OExchange](http://www.oexchange.org/spec/).\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgement\r\n\r\n**ActivityStreams** was developed by Martin Atkins, Will Norris, Chris Messina, Monica Wilkinson, and Rob Dolin.\r\n**Atom** was developed by Mark Nottingham and Robert Sayre.\r\n**Atom Threading Extensions** was developed by James M.
